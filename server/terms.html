<h1>Terms of use and policy</h1>
<h2>1. Accounts</h2>
<p>You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your
    account and Udemy will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login
    credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your
    permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some
    information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.</p>

<p>Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Udemy and use the Services. If you
    are
    younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live (for example, 13 in the
    US
    or 16 in Ireland), you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an
    account
    and help you access content that is appropriate for you. If you are below this age of consent to use online
    services,
    you may not create a Udemy account. If we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we
    will
    terminate your account. Under our Instructor Terms, you may be requested to verify your identity before you are
    authorized to submit content for publication on Udemy.</p>

<p>You can terminate your account at any time by following the steps here. Check our Privacy Policy to see what happens
    when you terminate your account.</p>

<h2>2. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access</h2>
<p>When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the Udemy Services and no
    other
    use. Don’t try to transfer or resell content in any way. We generally grant you a lifetime access license, except
    when
    we must disable the content because of legal or policy reasons or for enrollments via Subscription Plans.
    Under our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish content on Udemy, they grant Udemy a license to offer a license
    to
    the content to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a
    student,
    when you enroll in a course or other content, whether it’s free or paid content, you are getting a license from
    Udemy to
    view the content via the Udemy platform and Services, and Udemy is the licensor of record. Content is licensed, and
    not
    sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing
    account
    information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the content and sharing it on torrent sites).</p>

<p>In legal, more complete terms, Udemy grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
    access and view the content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial,
    educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions
    associated
    with the particular content or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not
    reproduce,
    redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of,
    sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any content unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written
    agreement signed by a Udemy authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our
    APIs.</p>

<p>We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course or other content. However,
    we
    reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point in time in the event where we
    decide
    or are obligated to disable access to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or
    other
    content you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust & Safety
    Guidelines. This lifetime access license does not apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans or to add-on features
    and
    services associated with the course or other content you enroll in. For example, instructors may decide at any time
    to
    no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with the content. To be clear, the lifetime
    access
    is to the course content but not to the instructor.</p>
